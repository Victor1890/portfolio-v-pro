Hello, I'm **Victor Rosario**, a Technologist, graduate of the Technological Institute of the Americas (ITLA). Currently, I work as a Frontend Developer at the National Competitiveness Council, utilizing various software such as **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, **PL/SQL**, **REST APIs**, **Blockchain Technologies**, **Redis**, **Docker**, **WebSocket**, and **Socket.io**.

I have over 4 years of experience in software development, which has allowed me to:

- Keep system versions always up to date.
- Ensure servers and databases are running optimally.
- Reduce costs related to external personnel support.
- Design and implement a high-definition blockchain bitcoin information system (bitcoin-blockchain-information), resulting in a 50% reduction in user wait times.
- Lead and implement new payment processing systems, both crypto and banking services.
- Among my notable professional skills are creativity, adaptability, teamwork, and communication skills.

I am continually investing in professional development, enabling personal and professional growth. I am open to virtual/freelance job opportunities.

Thank you for visiting my profile and taking the time to get to know me in this space. I hope we can connect.

I love my work and take great enjoyment (sometimes frustration) in every project that I take on. Feel free to check out my portfolio. If you have any questions or are interested in working with me, don't hesitate to reach out to me on Twitter or you can send me a mail at me@j471n.in. I have also written an article explaining the process I followed to create my portfolio. You can also take a look at the full code at GitHub.
